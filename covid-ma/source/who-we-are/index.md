We are a pair of volunteers who want to help Massachusetts residents get vaccintated.

**Q: Why are you doing this? Isn't there a state site?**

Massachusetts is 34th out of 50 states in percentage of doses adminstered, [according to the CDC](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html). The [existing site](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-vaccine-locations-for-individuals-currently-eligible-to-be-vaccinated#find-a-location-to-get-vaccinated-if-eligible-) is confusing, hard to navigate, and requires multiple click-throughs to find availability. We want to make this process easier.

**Q: What if I want to help?**
